# Undocking-Script
Undocking script that records window sizes and positions when run, and restores them when you re-dock your PC. This script was created for enterprise users that work with a laptop docking station with external monitors connected. Please feel free to report any bugs or issues with as much detail as possible and I will be happy to review it and correct them.

See the lower half of the main script for commented details on what each line of code is for. Feel free to further customize the script to your liking. This script can be downloaded, modified, and redistributed freely, but only without compensation of any kind.
